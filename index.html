                <strong>Stone Bricks <s>Only</s></strong> is a building supply company that provides bricks made from stone, besides the other building materials and things that go with them. The main plant is located somewhere far from civilization for safety and environmental reasons, but we do have a warehouse in Ottawa for delivery. Starting in 2002, we have developed a process for extracting stone that is sustainable and with the minimum of environmental impacts. We sell bricks that are precisely cut for fit, and not just that, but tile floors and pavers that match the bricks, the mortar you need to bond them together, a bunch of beams, plates, and girders to build stronger buildings, and much more. Our belief is that stone is the most abundant material on Earth, and therefore should be used more often in construction.
