                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <img src="./images/blocks.png" class="palletImage" alt="An isometric pallet of stone bricks">
                <p>The idea for Stone Bricks Only stems from our belief that stone is the most common material on Earth, especially when you count Earth's mantle. Furthermore, most other building materials have environmental drawbacks: In particular, wood is obtained through cutting down trees (i.e. deforestation). Quarry operations involve deforestation as well, and deep-sea mining is a definite no-no. To encourage the use of stone bricks, we decided to provide a plentiful supply of stone bricks.</p>
                <p>Given the environmental impacts of other methods of mining, we decided to, therefore, extract stone from Earth's mantle, just as one would drill oil. The heat of the mantle also provided geothermal energy for the operations. a safe location far from the forests was chosen for safety and environmental reasons.</p>
                <p>Our manufacturing system is almost completely self-contained except for repairs - we extract some metal from the extracted stone to make some of our bonus products, and the rest gets cut into our namesake bricks. Very few outside contractors were required.</p>
                <p>However, at the beginning, we didn't have the metal refiner, and all we could sell back then were the stone bricks, hence the name of "Stone Bricks Only" Even when the bonus products arrived, the name still stuck and is still in use today.</p>
                <p>We are primarily aimed at other construction companies. Residential and industrial development are primary markets for our bricks. Renovators can also get an alternative to wood through our product lineup - plus, you don't have to make your own bricks!</p>
                <p>The bonus products make us unique. Including a range of stone tiles, walkway pavers, and ceiling tiles, which match the bricks; mortar to bond the bricks together; a structural girder, plate, and truss system and some carbon nanotubes, to make the buildings tougher; windows and doors; and more! You can construct a complete building using only this <a href="./products.html" class="notLearnMore">modular brick system</a>.</p>
                <p>Today, we maintain are belief of stone being the most common material on Earth, while producing the bonus products. We will continue to provide the supply of stone bricks we have planned to deliver for the forseeable future... hopefully.</p>
